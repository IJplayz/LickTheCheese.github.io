When i installed Arch on my Acer c720 Chromebook for the first time, i noticed
that it would not suspend correctly. It suspended fine, but when it resumed,
it usually rebooted for some reason.
<br>
Since there was not a working solution for me in the Arch Wiki, i am making
this article so other new Arch users do not also have to hunt through the
Arch Forums for a few hours as i had to.
<br>
Note that this article is for new users of Arch who <i>already</i> looked at
the Arch Wiki and the solutions did not work. This article also assumes you
use GRUB as your bootloader.
