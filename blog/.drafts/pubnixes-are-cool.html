i recently joined a Linux User Group at a local library and one of the members
was an admin of a pubnix called <a href="https://tilde.team">tilde.team</a>
and they gave everyone there accounts on it. At first, it seemed suspicious,
why would someone randomly give a bunch of people ssh access to their server?
If you go on it, you will quickly see the amazing community and all the
fun things it has.

also where did the tildeverse wikipedia page go?
