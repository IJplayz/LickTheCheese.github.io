<h1>Suspending on a chromebook with Arch</h1>

When i installed Arch on my Acer c720 Chromebook for the first time, i noticed
that it would not suspend correctly. It suspended fine, but when it resumed,
it usually rebooted for some reason.
<br>
Since there was not a working solution for me in the Arch Wiki, i am making
this article so other new Arch users do not also have to hunt through the
Arch Forums for a few hours as i had to.
<br>
Note that this article is for new users of Arch who <i>already</i> looked at
the Arch Wiki and the solutions did not work. This article also assumes you
use GRUB as your bootloader.
<br>
Open <kbd>/etc/default/grub</kbd> and add <pre>tpm_tis.interrupts=0 modprobe.blacklist=ehci_hcd,ehci_pci</pre> to the <kbd>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</kbd> line (inside the quote, before the watchdog part if it is there).
<br>
Then, rebuild your grub config with <kbd>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</kbd>
<br>
Basically what this does is disable a few kernel modules that you dont need
and do things that stop it from successfully waking from a suspend. If you do
this, you should probably research what these modules do and if you are going
to use them, this article is just to point new users in the right direction
to fix their suspending.
