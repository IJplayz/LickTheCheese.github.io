# this blog now uses bmd
instead of doing weird script stuff to manage the blog posts
bmd just parses the markdown, generates post files, and then
it makes an index. its so much simpler than lb however once
there are a bunch of blog posts, it will have to parse them all
every time, which will be annoying, so old things might be removed
from the index.

over the next few days i will be copying over some of my
old blog posts to here, however the permalinks will stay where
they were before for a while.
