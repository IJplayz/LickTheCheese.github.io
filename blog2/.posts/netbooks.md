# bring netbooks back
netbooks were good laptops and if you
did not care that they were THICCC or that the keyboard is a bit cramped
they were a m a z i n g.

chromebooks are much less durable and they run chrome os, which you cant
do much with. if a laptop manufacturer is reading this, i would buy a netbook
with modern specs if you manufacture it for not too expensive :)
