# my website is a bit of a mess
i will probably update my
website's css to be closer to this blog's css (which is loosly based on
[team/css](https://tildegit.org/team/css), the "hacker bootstrap" css)
because the main websites coloring is just too bright and it hurts my eyes.
not sure what i was thinking when i chose to use such a bright color...
