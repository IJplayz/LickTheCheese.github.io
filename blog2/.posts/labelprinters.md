# label printers are fun
i just bought a label printer and
it is really fun to use, however the label tape is a bit expensive :sad_face:

## did brother know?
if you have shopped for a label printer, you would probably know brother's line of label printers are called P-Touch. Consequently the name of it makes it sound
like you are going to touch your brother's pp. I feel like they knew what they
did when they were creating the name, but i am not sure.
