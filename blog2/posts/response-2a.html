<p>In my program, one of the difficulties I faced was when the score number would not reset once I replay the game. I was able to resolve this by setting the score variable back to zero and setting the score label to zero when the replay button is pressed. Another issue I faced was when it would require 7 clicks instead of 6 because I used the &gt; operator instead of the &gt;= operator. I was able to fix this by using a &gt;= operator. One opportunity to improve my program was to use actual pictures of Owen Castro in my program. I was able to accomplish this by looking on Google Images for an hour and not finding anything, and then finally deciding to follow him after class and creepily take pictures of him in the hallway. Of course, this probably does not count as an opportunity, so I also had the opportunity to shrink the object to click on every time you click. I was able to do this by using the setSize function and setting the size to how big it should be based on how many times the user has clicked.</p>
