<h1>my website is a bit of a mess</h1>
<p>i will probably update my
website's css to be closer to this blog's css (which is loosly based on
<a href="https://tildegit.org/team/css">team/css</a>, the &quot;hacker bootstrap&quot; css)
because the main websites coloring is just too bright and it hurts my eyes.
not sure what i was thinking when i chose to use such a bright color...</p>
